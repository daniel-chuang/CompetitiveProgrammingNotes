# Uses of sorting

Sorting is fundamental to algorithms. Many other algorithms use sorting as a subprocess
because it helps them solve the process much much quicker. For example, a problem like
"does an array contain two equal elements" is very easy to solve with sorting. Same for a 
problem like "what is the most frequent element."
